TODO:
*High priority*
- review the code for the filling of the universe
- add unit testing (failure testing as well as success)
- find the right abstraction for Box manipulation
  (more functional, less association lists in the abstraction)
- fix mutual in bnfc
- abstract names and dim (remove hack with {0,1} + ...)
- monadic eval(?(!))
- find a characterization for neutral values
- eta for constructors
- reorganize the primitive notions 
  - subst can be defined in terms of transport
  - J in terms of mapOnPath, transport and contractible
- fix showVal for
  - VVar X(x1,...,xn),
  - Kan (remove extra parenthesis), ...

*Undecided priority*
- Quickcheck for box shapes?

*Low priority*
- rudimentary emacs mode (send the current buffer to a process)
- auto-completion in the main loop
- namespacing
- make the import system-independent
